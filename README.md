In todays lab we had 4 tasks to create a game, 
1. Draw lanes in the background
2. Draw cars that bounce off the walls in the lanes. Make sure to use classes to randomize their speed and color. Optional: You make them continuously loop through.
3. Have a frog at the bottom of the screen that can cross the lanes.
4. Bonus: Make the frog and the car "crash".

bye using classes and functions I was able to make my background the style of a river with logs in between to make it similar to the real game frogger. I also used key codes to make my frog movable around the screen so he can dodge the cars. 

I also created a car thats supposed to travel across the screen that the frog has to dodge
